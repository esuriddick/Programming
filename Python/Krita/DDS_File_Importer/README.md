# DDS File Importer
A Python plugin for use in [Krita](https://krita.org).

## What is DDS File Importer?
A Python plugin made specifically for [Krita](https://krita.org) that resorts to [Microsoft's texconv](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki/Texconv) to convert image files to/from DDS.

## Functionalities
When executed, this plugin will import the selected DDS file into Krita as either a _TGA_, _PNG_ or _TIF_ file (you choose which one in the window that appears). The original _TGA_/_PNG_/_TIF_ file is erased, so any change performed to the file must be saved either through _File_ > _Save As_, or use the _Tools_ > _Scripts_ > _Export as DDS_ (if you have installed my [DDS File Exporter](https://github.com/esuriddick/Programming/tree/main/Python/Krita/DDS_File_Exporter)).

### Installation
There are two different ways to install Python plugins in [Krita](https://krita.org):
#### First Method
1. Open [Krita](https://krita.org) and go to _Tools_ > _Scripts_ > _Import Python Plugins..._, and select the **DDS_File_Importer.zip** archive.
2. Restart [Krita](https://krita.org).
3. Go to _Settings_ > _Configure Krita..._ > _Python Plugin Manager_, and click the checkbox to the left of the field that says **DDS File Importer**.
4. Restart [Krita](https://krita.org).

#### Second Method
1. Extract the content within the folder **DDS_File_Importer** to the folder **pykrita** (typically located here: C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\krita, where **USERNAME** should be replaced with your Windows username).
2. Restart [Krita](https://krita.org).
3. Go to _Settings_ > _Configure Krita..._ > _Python Plugin Manager_, and click the checkbox to the left of the field that says **DDS File Importer**.
4. Restart [Krita](https://krita.org).

### Execute
Go to the menu item _Tools_ > _Scripts_, and press the option named _Import DDS_. Choose the desired format to convert the DDS file into, and then it will appear in Krita.

### Tested platforms
I have tested version 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 of this plugin in version 5.1.5 of [Krita](https://krita.org).

## Change log
_[2024-06-19] Version 1.3_
- Compatibility with Linux is implemented - Thanks to Liniya.

_[2023-11-05] Version 1.2_
- Changed one of the arguments in the command line from '-srgbi' to '-srgb' to avoid darkening when importing specific formats of DDS (namely the ones ending with "_SRGB").
- Updated the Texconv file packed with the plugin.

_[2023-09-04] Version 1.1_
- Added a dialog window to pop-up when executing this script to allow you to select the format to convert the DDS file into.

_[2023-09-04] Version 1.0_
- Initial version released.
